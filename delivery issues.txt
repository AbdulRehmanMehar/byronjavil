There are many issues in it. You didn't follow the layout sheet properly.

I tried to create one role as supervisor and Manager but when I click on Manager and click on view address it says Unauthorized.

There should be Archive folder under Manager account. There should be select files option also so the person can select it and move it to archive folder. Select all option too. If I will select any property to archive will it remove from all the user? Let me know about it.

How many addresses it will show at a time on page under each account?

Please make sure you do all these corrections correctly and asap.
